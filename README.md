# Interactive-Brokers-TWS-API-Python
Synchronized TWS API of Interactive Brokers: download and insert into PostgreSQL database(for historical bars and ticks only for now)

My first python project I have been working on since December 2020. There are quite a few other functions I have finished but not included in this repository, such as data filtering, requesting live data, plotting as many as you want charts according to criterias, etc. as they still need more work.

Event driven data requsting and handling are used in functions in Main.py

I am new to python and it is still a very original version, do NOT be mad if it crashes. 

Feel free to alter and improve. You are welcome.
